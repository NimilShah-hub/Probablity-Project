Abstract</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Rabies claims the lives of an estimated 59,000 people each year, over 20,000 of which are in India primarily among children in rural or marginalized populations. Rabies is a classic One Health challenge, more than 99 percent of these deaths arise from exposure to a rabid dog. Vaccines exist to prevent canine rabies as do human vaccines, which are the primary component to cure after a dog bite.</p>

<p>Here the uncertainty is in, a number of control measures such as mass vaccination and culling have been implemented to stop rabies epidemics, but they are not perfectly effective. However on learning more about this topic, the root uncertainty turned out to be how the transmission of rabies takes place. A lot of factors such as whether the dog was vaccinate and even after vaccination is there a probability of transmission? Is the dog infected one? Is there a probability of person being infected even after taking vaccination? This uncertainty prevents us from completely eradicating Rabies.</p>


<p>We will derive inference of uncertainties in our model by using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedures for calculating the mortality rate of humans.We will also like to construct likelihood function to evaluate that as the parameter of vaccination increases mortality rate decreases. To derive this formula we will be using binomial,poisson and gaussian distribution. This way we will try to prevent the deaths occurring due to rabies</p><br/>

<p>On the basis of our market survey and visits in hospitals we have plottted deaths cause due to rabies in previous years according to age. On studying our model, we figured out that the parameter of vaccination turns out to be the most efffective one in order to reduce deaths. As shown in fig of vaccination we have increased it's supply for the upcoming years whose effect is obsered directly in the final graph. Three death rates have been ploted in the final graph.</p>
<p>1)With steady rate of increase in vaccination.</p>
<p>2)With 20% increase.</p>
<p>3)With 30% increase. </p>
<p>Thus, we can conclude that death rates are decreased in large amounts by increasing the parameter of Vaccination in our Prediction Model
